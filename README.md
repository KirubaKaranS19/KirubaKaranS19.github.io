# Ethereum Transferring Web Application

This repository is used as an hosting repository for the Full stack Ethereum Transferring Application.

A blockchain is a decentralised, distributed digital ledger that is employed to securely and openly record transactions across several computers. It is just a list of data that is constantly expanding and secured by encryption. These records are called blocks.

Each block includes transaction information, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the one before it. As any change to a block necessitates rehashing every following block, the hash serves as a unique identifier that protects the chain's integrity. As a result, the blockchain is practically unchangeable and impervious to tampering.

Decentralised apps (dApps) may be created on top of the **Ethereum** blockchain by programmers using smart contracts.

Smart contracts are self-executing computer programmes that instantly carry out the terms of a contract between two parties. They operate on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a runtime environment that enables decentralised execution of smart contracts.

This site is built using Ethereum Smart contracts to reduce the gas charge that is generated during any transaction. This application helps to link your wallet and transfer ERC-20 tokens to any other wallets in the market.
